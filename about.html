    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm <strong>Ritesh Kumar</strong>, an adaptable and dedicated technology professional currently pursuing a <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)</strong>. With a strong foundation in technical support and data operations from my time at Lovely Professional University, I’ve grown into a multifaceted engineer with experience across the software development life cycle, automation, and data handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey began with ensuring accurate data systems and supporting IT infrastructure, which sharpened my analytical thinking and attention to detail. Over time, this experience inspired me to take on more dynamic challenges in the digital space—ranging from building user-friendly applications to testing systems for performance and reliability, and even drawing insights from data to support smarter decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m well-versed in modern development tools and frameworks, have practical exposure to testing methodologies and automation suites, and enjoy working with data-driven platforms and visualization tools. I’m comfortable navigating between writing clean code, identifying software issues, and interpreting metrics to improve product outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in continuous learning and problem-solving through technology. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to a forward-thinking team where quality, efficiency, and user experience matter.
